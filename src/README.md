# HOMESERVER VPN/Transmission Infrastructure System

## System Overview

The HOMESERVER VPN/Transmission infrastructure represents a sophisticated, professional-grade digital sovereignty platform that provides secure, isolated network operations within a comprehensive vault security framework. This system is part of the larger HOMESERVER initialization suite that activates once a vault is released, maintaining strict separation between confidential code and operational infrastructure.

## Architecture & Design Philosophy

### Core Principles
- **Digital Sovereignty**: Complete independence from corporate surveillance and control
- **Network Isolation**: VPN traffic completely isolated in dedicated network namespaces
- **Template-Based Configuration**: Eliminates runtime RPC calls for faster, more reliable operation
- **Professional-Grade Infrastructure**: Enterprise-level reliability with consumer-grade simplicity
- **Secure Credential Management**: Credentials stored in encrypted vault with secure cleanup

### System Components

#### 1. **Network Namespace Management** (`vpn.py`)
- Creates isolated `vpn` network namespace for complete traffic isolation
- Establishes veth pair interfaces (`veth0`/`veth1`) for host-namespace communication
- Implements professional firewall management using nftables with comment-based rule binding
- Provides automatic IP forwarding and routing configuration
- Supports both Python-based PIA integration and legacy bash script fallbacks

#### 2. **Transmission Configuration Engine** (`templateEngine.py`)
- **Template-Based Architecture**: Pre-generates all configuration files from templates
- **Namespace-Aware Deployment**: Automatically deploys to `/etc/netns/vpn/transmission-daemon`
- **Secure Credential Handling**: Manages RPC authentication with proper file permissions
- **Validation & Verification**: Ensures generated configurations meet Transmission requirements
- **Cleanup Management**: Comprehensive cleanup of temporary and deployed configurations

#### 3. **Service Orchestration** (`transmissionLauncher.py`)
- **Main Orchestrator**: Coordinates VPN connection, Transmission startup, and health monitoring
- **Signal Handling**: Graceful shutdown with comprehensive teardown procedures
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of VPN namespace, Transmission daemon, and port forwarding
- **Automatic Recovery**: Self-healing capabilities for failed components
- **Keepalive Management**: Maintains persistent VPN namespace and service availability

#### 4. **Teardown & Cleanup** (`teardown.py`)
- **Perfect Teardown**: Complete cleanup sequence ensuring system returns to pristine state
- **Emergency Teardown**: Aggressive cleanup for failed component scenarios
- **Verification System**: Comprehensive post-cleanup validation
- **Process Management**: Terminates all related processes with namespace awareness
- **Resource Cleanup**: Removes firewall rules, network devices, and configuration files

#### 5. **Configuration Management**
- **Hardcoded Configuration**: System parameters are hardcoded for reliability
- **Environment Variables**: Some overrides available via `HOMESERVER_*` environment variables
- **Security Defaults**: Security-first configuration with secure credential handling

## Operational Workflow

### 1. **Initialization Phase**
```
Vault Release → mountDrive.sh → Network Interface Setup → VPN Namespace Creation
```

### 2. **VPN Connection Phase**
```
PIA Integration → Port Forwarding → Firewall Rule Configuration → Network Isolation
```

### 3. **Transmission Deployment Phase**
```
Template Generation → Configuration Deployment → Daemon Startup → RPC Configuration
```

### 4. **Operational Phase**
```
Health Monitoring → Automatic Recovery → Port Forwarding Keepalive → Service Persistence
```

### 5. **Teardown Phase**
```
Signal Handling → Process Termination → Configuration Cleanup → Resource Removal
```

## Security Architecture

### **Network Isolation**
- Complete VPN traffic isolation in dedicated namespace
- No cross-contamination between VPN and host network traffic

- Automatic cleanup prevents rule persistence

### **Credential Security**
- Credentials stored in encrypted vault directory
- Secure file permissions (0600) for configuration files
- Automatic credential cleanup on teardown
- No credential persistence in logs or temporary files

### **Process Security**
- All operations require root privileges or passwordless sudo
- Namespace-aware process management
- Secure signal handling prevents unauthorized access
- Comprehensive process termination and cleanup

## Integration Points
